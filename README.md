# Eric Lee's Dotfiles

![Neovim Configuration](bin/img/neovim.png)

![Firefox Configuration](bin/img/firefox.png)

Personalized Dotfiles for MacOS with Yabai and Neovim. Shortcuts managed with [skhd](https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd), [karabiner-elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/), [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/)

## Terminal Workflow

[Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) is my editor of choice, due to customizability, Native LSP, universal versatility, and performance. [Kitty](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty) is my choice of terminal emulator, as it is much faster than iTerm. Terminal theme is [powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) with zsh.

Neovim Installation

 - Copy `.config/nvim` to machine
 - Run `nvim`, `:PlugInstall`
 - Restart neovim, `:LspInstall <LSP>`

Neovim Features

 - Notetaking configuration with LaTeX or Markdown
 - Native LSP config for many programming languages with Treesitter
 - Nice Statusline and Bufferline
 - < 100ms startup time

## Window Management
